get_acceleration_penalty_per_stop method:
    Returns a per-stop time penalty (in seconds) based on driver behavior.
    Speeders receive a higher penalty due to aggressive acceleration and stop-start inefficiency.

    Based on:
    - J.S. Held Study on intersection behavior:
      https://www.jsheld.com/insights/articles/a-naturalistic-study-of-vehicle-acceleration-and-deceleration-at-an-intersection
    - Hypertextbook on average car acceleration:

generate_random_cycle method:

- cycle_duration: Randomly chosen between 55–75 seconds.
  Source: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) — Signal Timing Basics.
  https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop08024/chapter3.htm

- green_duration: Set to 50% of total cycle.
  Source: Common practice in coordinated traffic signal systems.
  https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop08024/chapter3.htm

- yellow_duration: Fixed at 4.0 seconds.
  Source: FHWA recommendation (typically 3–5 seconds based on approach speed).
  https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/intersection/conventional/yellow/

- red_duration: Calculated as the remainder of the cycle after subtracting green and yellow durations.

assign_offset_to_light method:

- Purpose: Simulates partial green wave coordination by assigning a time offset to the traffic light’s cycle. This offset determines where in the cycle the light begins relative to simulation start.

- Behavior: 
  - With 45% probability, the light’s offset is calculated to sync with a steady driver’s expected arrival time, creating the possibility of a green wave.
  - With 55% probability, the light receives a random offset, making it behave independently and simulating imperfect real-world signal coordination.

- Why this is realistic:
  In most cities, not all traffic lights are coordinated. Signal coordination typically occurs in timed corridors or “zones,” and only a portion of lights follow green wave patterns. This approach models that by giving the steady driver a better (but not perfect) experience.
